This little tool is a protype for a universal keyboard & mouse mapping to a virtual gamepad.

Initially developed for use with Wii U emulator `Cemu`. But then I got a controller...

So yeah, fork it or whatever you do with it, just don't play multiplayer games to get aim assist, that's just pathetic. <3
